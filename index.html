        <h1>My Resume</h1>
        <p>While I've been working in the wine industry since 2012, I was also born into it. My earliest memories are of helping my dad "count the drawers" (i.e., him giving me coins and trick me into doing math) and playing with toys out of my wooden Anhueser-Busch toybox. Constantly being a person interested in learning all of the things, my college degree ended up being in General Studies with minors in Business and Sociology in 2012. That same year, I started working at Thirst Wine Merchants, a locally-owned distributor of fine wines and spirits. After the state liquor law overhaul of 2018, the company formed a partnership with 2 other local distributors and began wholeselling through an additional company, Revolution Wholesale. Doing work not only for Thirst but for the other entities as well, it only made sense to be employed by Revolution Wholesale. During my professional career, my primary focus has been on designing marketing materials, web content & design, & data management with additional focuses in internal and external communications, social media, data reporting, photography, dashboard design, e-commerce, internal and external support, event planning, and more. </p>
